## A research question you could answer using regression analysis on this dataset

How literacy and levels of income of the head of Household relate to number of children and number of people in each household.

## Citations for two research articles that address a question related to the one you’ve identified.

## The definition of your sample population (e.g. who is included and who isn't).

This sample includes Data at the Household level Specifically on head of household regardless of who that is (father, mother).Supporting incomes from other members of the household have been excluded. The data is only for the year 2015. This dataset also excludes incomes less than ME$100 and more than $500,000.

## Data

For this analysis, we are using microdata from 2015 sample for Mexico as downloaded from IPUMS International: Minnesota Population Center. Integrated Public Use Microdata Series, International: Version 7.3 [dataset]. Minneapolis, MN: IPUMS, 2020.https://doi.org/10.18128/D020.V7.2

we are going to analyze the following variables:

1. PERSONS:Number of people per household(Continuous), 
2. URBAN:Urban-Rural status (Categorical)
3. NCHILD: Number of children per household (Continuous), 
4. LIT_HEAD:Literacy of Head of Household (Categorical)
5. INCEARN_HEAD:Earned Income for Head of Household(Continuous)

## The number of observations (rows) in your dataset.

The number of observations for the complete dataset is 4,575,476 households.

Identify one of your continuous variables as your dependent variable. Test the relationship between your dependent variable and each of the other variables in your dataset. Indicate the significance and (if appropriate) the magnitude of each relationship.

If you really want to estimate a model predicting a categorical variable, come talk to me about it well before this assignment is due. I will try to talk you out of it and, failing that, modify your assignment to allow you to use logistic regression.

Dependent Variable: 

Number of Children -Number_of_children_hist_df 

test relationship with: 

Income -Head_ofhousehold_Incomehist_df
Literacy -Head_of_householdliteracy
Rural-Urban -Urban_Rural
People in Household -Household_pop_hist_df


corrs <- svycor(Number_of_children_hist_df + Head_ofhousehold_Incomehist_df + Household_pop_hist_df, design = svy_data, sig.stats = TRUE)
